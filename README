ImmutableAttributes
===================

When you want to prevent certain attributes from being changed once set you can declare them as immutable:

class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_immutable :permalink, :param_identifier
end

When MyModel.find(:first).permalink = 'anything' is called it will raise an ImmutableAttributeError
MyModel.new.permalink = 'works!' will properly set the value because the record is unsaved.
